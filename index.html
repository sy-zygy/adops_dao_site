            love for web3. In the web2 world we have helped clients generate over $2.5B+ in sales and have manged ad
            budgets as high as $50M/month. We want to take that experience and put it to work for worthy DAO projects.

            campaigns
            are easy to fuck up. Like anything else it takes experience to develop the instincts in AdOps
            to make your campaign perform the best possible, focus on the insights generated from the experiment and
            roll that
            knowledge into your next campaign.</p>
